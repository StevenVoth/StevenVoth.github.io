        <h2>The Do's and Don'ts of Building a Flight Simulation Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Getting started with flight simulation can be both exciting and overwhelming. It's important to know that you don't need an elaborate setup to enjoy the experience. Below are some tips to help you get started without going overboard.
        </p>

            <p class="image-caption">Don't go overboard with complex setups like this one!</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Start with the basics. A simple joystick or even a gamepad can suffice for beginners. As you become more invested, you can explore more advanced equipment that enhances the realism of your simulation experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating a Versatile Flight Simulation Setup</h2>

        <p>
            When selecting your hardware, consider investing in components that are versatile and not specific to a single type of aircraft. This approach allows you to explore various aircraft within the simulator without feeling restricted.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li>
                <strong>Universal Flight Controls:</strong> Opt for yokes, joysticks, or throttles that can simulate both general aviation and commercial aircraft.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Modular Add-ons:</strong> Choose hardware that can be expanded or customized with additional modules, such as switch panels or rudder pedals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjustable Settings:</strong> Look for controls with programmable buttons and sensitivity adjustments to tailor the experience to different aircraft types.
            </li>
        </ul>
